Network protocol for client/server

Everything is sent as strings, with spaces in between values. The first value is the message type, followed by
parameters specific to that type.

Logging in:
	login <username> <password>
	- This is sent from the client to the server.
	- The username and password should not contain any spaces.
	- The server should respond 'OK' if the combination matches, or 'Fail' otherwise.

	- An example: login student 12345
		- username: student, password: 12345
		- response: OK (since in this example the username and password is correct)

Retrieving level info:
	levelinfo <username>
	- This is sent from the client to the server.
	- The username should not contain any spaces.
	- The server should respond with a space-separated list of scores for each level. If the username is
		invalid, the server will return a blank string.

	- An example: levelinfo student
		- username: student
		- response: 300 400 0 0
			- first level: 300, second: 400, third and fourth: 0

A level has been completed:
	level <username> <level> <score>
	- This is sent from the client to the server.
	- The username should not contain any spaces.
	- The server should respond with an 'OK' or 'Fail', depending on the success of the SQL server interface.

	- An example: level student 1 450
		- username: student
		- level ID: 1
		- score: 450
